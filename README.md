## Setup & Installation üöÄ

Since the project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with CDN links for Tailwind and Lucide, setup is straightforward:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd TypeFaster
    ```
2.  **Ensure files are linked:** Make sure your `index.html` file correctly links to your `style.css` and `script.js` files:
    ```html
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        </head>
    <body>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>
    ```
3.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

No build steps or dependencies are required beyond a modern web browser.
